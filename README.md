Mock Prescription Form

This is a mock prescription form which creates a datatable output of manual input data as well as data pulled from .pdf sources.

pres_dent_eng_2014_apx2.csv is a data set of commonly prescribed medications by dentists, save it to your working directory and update the code to pull the data set for scriptData

Two directory files need to be created within the working directory, "Prescriptions" is the repository for .csv outputs 
"PDF Prescriptions" is the repository of .pdf mock prescriptions

mock_prescription.pdf is a file showing the format of .pdf which the script will recognize and analyze
